# Distribution-Systems-Modeling
Bus admittance matrix is far easier to form compared to bus impedance matrix
and has countable benefits. So, this paper models all distribution side components and
builds the admittance matrix that are in-fact suitable for Z-Bus load flow. This paper
has detailed models of wye and delta connected constant-power, constant-current, and
constant-impedance loads. All the series elements in distribution sides namely transmission lines, 
step-voltage regulators, and transformers are also modeled. The other
half of the paper goes into the investigation of the invertibility of Y-Bus and feasibility
of using Z-Bus load flow as a power flow solver. Right at end, paper provides online
links where there are MATLAB scripts designed to model the components of some
IEEE standard buses. IEEE 37 standard system is modeled using the online script and
results are analyzed.
